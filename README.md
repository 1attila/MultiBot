# MultiBot
A discord bot written in python for the MultiTech server over 3 years ago with various utilities for embeds, chat-bridge, applications, polls and a lot more!

At the time, this was my first "large" codebase, and my very first program in python so it's not very well organized and the code quality it's not the best.
Horever it's still usable and does it's job anyways. I'm working to build a new one with even more features, probably with [Conduit](https://github.com/1attila/Conduit) integrations aswell to make really cool things, stai tuned!

# Setup
It's pretty easy to setup:
- Create a discord bot and invite it to your server
- Get the Application speadsheet credential file and rename it `creds.json`
- Setup ```Config.json```; fields should be pretty self-explanatory
- Run the bot!
